Clean Code Rule for Cursor
Use meaningful, descriptive names for variables, functions, and classes.
Functions should be small and focused, doing only one thing.
Avoid magic numbers/strings — replace them with named constants.

Prefer explicitness over cleverness — write code that is easy to read, not just easy to write.
Add docstrings or comments only where necessary (why, not what).
Follow a consistent style (indentation, spacing, naming conventions).
Handle errors gracefully instead of ignoring exceptions.
Delete unused code, imports, or variables immediately.
